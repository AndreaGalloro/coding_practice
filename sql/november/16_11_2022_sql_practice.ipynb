    "SELECT OrderID, Quantity,\n",

    "    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'\n",

    "Another solution to the original question that does not create new columns but contains the same information would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 'laptop'\n",
    "        WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 'mobile'\n",
