    "A pharmacy wants to better understand how different drugs are selling. Given the data below, write a query to find the total sales of drugs for each manufacturer. Your answer should be rounded to the closest million, and report your results in descending order of total sales. Your answer should also be formatted like this \"$36 million\"\n",

    "There are a couple of challenging points for this problem. One, we need to convert the data type of the total sales sum before we can use the round function, so I used `POWER(10.0, 6)` instead of `POWER(10, 6)`. Second, they want the results to be in the form of a string, so we needed to extract only the millions from the numbers, then `CAST` them to a varchar, then `CONCAT` them with the desired strings to form the final format. Lastly, I tried to do that all at once without using a subquery, but the `ORDER BY` was messed up because it was ordering by a string now instead of a numeric. So we needed the subquery to aggregate, then cast it to a varchar, then order by the original numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so it is actually possible to do it without a common table expression, you just order by the aggregation instead of the calculated field.\n",
