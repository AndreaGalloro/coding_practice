    "A pharmacy wants to better understand how different drugs are selling. Given the data below, write a query to find the top most profitable drugs sold and how much profit they made. Write a query to find out which manufacturer is associated with the drugs that were not profitable and how much money the pharmacy lost on these drugs. Output the manufacturer, number of drugs, and total losses. Total losses should be in absolute value. Display the results with the highest losses on top.\n",

    "So, first we generate a new table from the original table that contains the profit as a new column. Then, we group by the manufacturer, aggregating with count to find the number of drugs each manufacturer has, and taking the sum of the absolute value of the \"profit\" as the total losses. However, we only want to consider a drug that has a negative profit, i.e. a loss.\n",
